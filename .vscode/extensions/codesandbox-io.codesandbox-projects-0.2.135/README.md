<p align="center">The power of CodeSandbox within the comfort of Visual Studio Code.</p>

CodeSandbox is a cloud development platform that empowers development teams to code, collaborate, and ship projects of any size from any device in record time.

This is an extension for Visual Studio Code that enables the features of CodeSandbox right from the IDE, both for Devboxes and Repositories.

## Features

### Branches

Create a branch or seamlessly switch between the existing ones from the UI or the command palette.

### Tasks

Define, run, and automate your project's tasks. Reduce manual load by configuring tasks to run when the project is set up, like `npm start`, or whenever your teammate installs a new dependency.

### Live collaboration

Build great ideas together. Collaborate with multiple teammates on the same branch just by switching to it. That includes developers joining from the [online editor](https://codesandbox.io/docs/projects/learn/introduction/overview) or our [iOS app](https://codesandbox.io/docs/ios/overview). Forget the boundaries of devices, and focus on making software happen.

### Live terminals

Spawn terminals and share them with your team to demo your work or debug things together. The terminals you create are automatically visible to everyone who's collaborating with you on the same branch, regardless of where they join from.

### And many more

There are countless other features that CodeSandbox provides to enhance your development experience. Those include interactive READMEs, integrated devtools, previews, and many more. Get familiar with the entire set of features [here](https://codesandbox.io/docs/projects/learn/introduction/overview).
